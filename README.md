* This is a simulatior of SpatialTouch, a novel cross-reality environment that seamlessly integrates a monoscopic 2D surface (an interactive screen with touch and pen input) with a stereoscopic 3D space (an augmented reality HMD) to jointly host spatial data visualizations. 
* The visualization below the screen is projected on the surface. The visualization above the screen is rendered in AR HMD. `Two views are seamlessly combined into a cohesive 3D representation from the first person view.`
